#GENETIX
We want to combine a HWID-Changer with specific usefull Tools you might need. 

And the first version of that product is: **GENETIX**
 
##So what does GENETIX do?
As I already said, Genetix is an updated Version of the old HWID-Changer. 

It has different Hashing Methodes, a secure Code Protection and some other usefull Stuff which is listed below. 
 
##What is a HWID?
So to easily explain this to you I'm gonna start by explaining what a HWID is. 

Basically there is no such thing as a HWID. Every hardware and also other things have their specific IDs which are NOT always unique. 

Hashing is a pretty strong encryption if you do it the right way. So if you get a new CPU you can't login anymore because the Loader
detects a new ID which does not fit with your first HWID.  So a HWID Changer grabs specific IDs from your Hardware and changes them. 
 
 
##Why is a HWID Changer usefull?
Well with a good HWID Changer you can bypass specific Bans from different games for example. 

Take Rust as an example... EAC detects your HWID and tracks you with that. 

If you got a HWID you might bypass this ban without resetting your PC.
